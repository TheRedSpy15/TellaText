# TellaText
SMS interceptor, designed for the visually impaired by simply providing an extremely visible menu whenever the user is texted. From there the user can see who texted them, and is given some choices:
- listen to the message (tts)
- call sender
- ignore
- replay with talk to text (**not implemented yet**)

To top it off, the UI is absolutely minimal, with a traffic light themed palette.

**Image?** Soon.  
**Release?** Currently aiming for this weekend.
