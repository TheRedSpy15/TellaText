# TellaText
SMS receiver, designed for the visually impaired by simply providing an extremely visible menu whenever the user is texted. From there the user can see who texted them, and is given some choices:
- listen to the message (tts)
- call sender
- ignore
- reply with talk to text (**not implemented yet**)

The UI is absolutely minimal, with a traffic light themed palette.

### Privacy
TellaText is open source & doesn't even use any internet what so ever. Your text messages are yours.

### Price
Free. I love to code. I need nothing more.

## Download
Eventually you will be able to download TellaText on F-droid & Google Play. **For now** you have to go to the release tab on GitHub, and download the .apk file, then run it.

### Other
**Image?** Soon.  
**Release?** Currently aiming for this weekend.
